## 💡 Design Philosophy Documented

### Simplicity Over Organization
- Start flat where possible
- Organize only when it adds value
- Simple relative paths

### Context Preservation
- Logs survive summarizations
- Patterns are explicit
- Examples are referenced
- Decisions are explained

### Consistency
- One shared CSS
- Clear naming conventions
- Standard file structure
- Predictable locations

### Scale Gradually
- Current structure handles dozens of lectures
- Can reorganize if needed
- Don't over-engineer
