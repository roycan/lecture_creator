## 🧠 Study Tips & Best Practices

### **How to Study Effectively:**

**1. Code Along (Don't Just Read!)**
```
❌ Wrong: Read lecture → move to next
✅ Right: Read section → code example → test it → experiment → next section
```

**2. Type Everything (No Copy-Paste)**
- Typing builds muscle memory
- Catching typos teaches debugging
- Forces you to read the code

**3. Break Down Projects**
```
❌ Wrong: "I'll build the whole thing at once"
✅ Right: 
   - Day 1: HTML structure
   - Day 2: CSS styling
   - Day 3: JavaScript logic
   - Day 4: Testing and polish
```

**4. Use the 50-10 Rule**
- Study for 50 minutes
- Break for 10 minutes (stand up, walk around)
- Prevents burnout
- Keeps focus sharp

**5. Debug Systematically**
```
When something breaks:
1. Read the error message (really read it!)
2. Check the line number
3. console.log() before and after
4. Simplify until it works
5. Add complexity back slowly
```

**6. Build Your Own Examples**
- Lecture uses sari-sari store? Build a bakery instead!
- Barangay directory? Make a school club directory!
- Customizing reinforces learning

**7. Teach Someone Else**
- Explain concepts to a friend/parent
- Write blog posts about what you learned
- Help classmates debug their code
- Teaching = deepest learning

**8. Keep a Learning Journal**
```markdown
## Today's Learning (Nov 13, 2025)
- Learned: Service workers cache resources
- Struggled with: Fetch event handler syntax
- Aha moment: "It's like a proxy between app and network!"
- Tomorrow: Practice offline detection
```

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **1. Tutorial Hell**
**Problem:** Watching tutorials endlessly without building  
**Solution:** After each lecture section, close it and code from memory

### **2. Copy-Paste Programming**
**Problem:** Copying code without understanding  
**Solution:** Type everything, even if you have the code in front of you

### **3. Perfectionism**
**Problem:** Won't move forward until "perfect"  
**Solution:** 80% good is good enough, you'll improve with practice

### **4. Skipping Fundamentals**
**Problem:** Jumping to "cool stuff" (React, AI) without basics  
**Solution:** Master HTML/CSS/JS first, frameworks come easy after

### **5. Not Committing to Git**
**Problem:** Losing code, no backup  
**Solution:** Commit often ("Early and often")

### **6. Ignoring Errors**
**Problem:** Code doesn't work, keep adding more code  
**Solution:** Fix errors immediately, don't build on broken foundation

### **7. Comparing to Others**
**Problem:** "They're faster than me, I'm not smart enough"  
**Solution:** Everyone learns at different pace, focus on your growth
