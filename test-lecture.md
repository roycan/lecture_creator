# Welcome to the Test Lecture

This is a test presentation to validate the export functionality. It includes various markdown elements to ensure proper rendering.

## Slide 2: Lists and Formatting

Here are some important points:

- First bullet point with **bold text**
- Second point with *italic text*
- Third point with `inline code`

### Ordered list example:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Slide 3: Special Characters

Let's test some edge cases:

- Text with "quotes" and 'apostrophes'
- HTML entities: &lt; &gt; &amp;
- Emoji: ðŸŽ“ ðŸ“š âœ¨

## Slide 4: Code Block

Here's some sample code:

```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, students!");
    // This includes </script> to test escaping
}
```

## Slide 5: Long Paragraph

This slide has a longer paragraph to test how the text-to-speech handles extended content. The system should break this into natural sentences and speak them with appropriate pauses. This helps ensure that students can follow along without the speech becoming too fast or monotonous.

## Slide 6: Simple Math

The formula for the area of a circle is:

A = Ï€rÂ²

Where r is the radius.
