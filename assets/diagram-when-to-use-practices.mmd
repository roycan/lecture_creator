# When to Use Production Practices - Decision Framework

## Quick Decision Tree

Ask yourself these 3 questions:

### 1. Who will use this?
```
Just me
  → Use BASIC practices
  → Example: Personal learning project

Classmates (10-50 users)
  → Use MEDIUM practices
  → Example: Class directory, group project

Real business (100+ users)
  → Use FULL practices
  → Example: Aling Rosa's sari-sari store POS

Government/Critical
  → Use CRITICAL practices (all + extras)
  → Example: Barangay certificate system
```

### 2. What happens if it breaks?
```
I get a bad grade
  → Use BASIC practices
  
Users annoyed but not critical
  → Use MEDIUM practices
  
Business loses money
  → Use FULL practices
  
Legal/safety problems
  → Use CRITICAL practices
```

### 3. How long will it run?
```
1 week demo
  → Use BASIC practices
  
1 semester (3-4 months)
  → Use MEDIUM practices
  
6+ months
  → Use FULL practices
  
Permanent/indefinite
  → Use CRITICAL practices
```

## Practice Levels Explained

### BASIC (School Projects)

**Use These:**
- ✅ Try-catch for database operations
- ✅ Basic error page (custom 404 and 500)
- ✅ .gitignore (node_modules, .env)
- ✅ README with setup instructions

**Skip These:**
- ❌ Winston logging (console.log is fine)
- ❌ Automatic backups (no cron needed)
- ❌ External monitoring (Railway metrics enough)
- ❌ Advanced security (no Helmet, CSRF, rate limiting)
- ❌ Performance optimization (not critical yet)

**Why:**
- Focus on learning core concepts
- Don't overwhelm with complexity
- 1-2 weeks only
- Teacher is only user

**Example Projects:**
- Barangay directory for class demo
- Sari-sari store inventory (learning exercise)
- Grade 9-Einstein attendance tracker

**Time to Implement:** 30 minutes

---

### MEDIUM (Personal/Group Projects)

**Use These:**
- ✅ Try-catch + error middleware
- ✅ Winston logging (info level)
- ✅ .env for any secrets (session secret, API keys)
- ✅ Manual backups (download button in admin)
- ✅ Basic health check (/health endpoint)
- ✅ Helmet (one line of code - why not?)

**Skip These:**
- ❌ Automatic backups (manual weekly is fine)
- ❌ UptimeRobot (Railway metrics enough for low stakes)
- ❌ CSRF protection (if no forms or read-only)
- ❌ Rate limiting (low traffic)
- ❌ Advanced performance (not needed yet)

**Why:**
- Balance learning with reasonable practices
- Used by classmates, not strangers
- Runs for 1 semester
- Not critical if it goes down for an hour

**Example Projects:**
- Class section directory (40 classmates use it)
- Personal portfolio with contact form
- Group project: Barangay website

**Time to Implement:** 2-3 hours

---

### FULL (Real Business/Client Projects)

**Use These:**
- ✅ ALL security practices:
  - Helmet
  - CSRF protection
  - Rate limiting
  - Input validation
  - Parameterized queries
- ✅ Winston logging (debug in dev, info in prod)
- ✅ Automatic daily backups (cron)
- ✅ UptimeRobot monitoring
- ✅ Performance optimization:
  - Compression
  - Caching
  - Query optimization
  - Pagination
- ✅ Complete error handling
- ✅ Health checks with database validation

**Skip These:**
- Nothing! Use everything in the lecture.

**Why:**
- Real money at stake
- Real users depend on it
- Owner expects reliability
- Runs 24/7
- Downtime costs sales

**Example Projects:**
- Aling Rosa's sari-sari store POS system
- Barangay San Juan resident directory
- Small business inventory management

**Time to Implement:** 8-12 hours (spread over days)

---

### CRITICAL (Government/High-Stakes Systems)

**Use These:**
- ✅ EVERYTHING from FULL level
- ✅ PLUS: Audit logging (who did what, when, from where)
- ✅ PLUS: Offsite backups (email weekly, Google Drive monthly)
- ✅ PLUS: Multiple alert contacts (email + SMS + Slack)
- ✅ PLUS: Formal testing (written test cases, UAT with users)
- ✅ PLUS: Documentation (user manual, admin guide, troubleshooting)
- ✅ PLUS: Compliance (data privacy, security policies)

**Why:**
- Public service responsibility
- Legal requirements (data privacy, audit trails)
- High reliability requirements
- Many concurrent users
- Data cannot be lost
- Security breaches have serious consequences

**Example Projects:**
- Barangay certificate issuance system
- Government permit application portal
- School enrollment system with grades

**Time to Implement:** 20-40 hours (proper project)

---

## Practice Prioritization

**If you only have time for 3 things:**
1. Try-catch for database operations ← Prevents crashes
2. Environment variables for secrets ← Security basics
3. Basic error pages ← User experience

**If you have time for 5 things:**
1-3 above, plus:
4. Winston logging ← Debugging and audit trail
5. Health check endpoint ← Know if it's working

**If you have time for 7 things:**
1-5 above, plus:
6. Compression ← One line of code, huge benefit!
7. Manual backup function ← Data protection

**If you have time for 10+ things (full production):**
1-7 above, plus:
8. Automatic backups ← Reliability
9. UptimeRobot monitoring ← Know when it breaks
10. Security packages (Helmet, rate limiting) ← Protect from attacks

## Red Flags (Common Mistakes)

### ❌ Mistake 1: Using EVERYTHING for a 1-week demo
**Problem:**
- Wastes time on setup instead of learning
- Over-complicates simple project
- Misses the point of the assignment

**Fix:**
- Use only BASIC practices
- Focus on features, not production
- Save advanced practices for real projects

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Using NOTHING for a real business
**Problem:**
- Data loss risk
- Security vulnerabilities
- Angry customers
- Lost money
- Reputation damage

**Fix:**
- Use FULL practices
- 8-12 hours setup is worth it
- Client deserves reliability

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Copying practices without understanding
**Problem:**
- "My friend uses Winston, so I will too"
- Don't know why or when to use it
- Can't explain to teacher/client

**Fix:**
- Understand WHY each practice exists
- Use decision framework above
- Choose appropriate level for YOUR project

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Premature optimization
**Problem:**
- Optimizing before performance problems exist
- "My site loads in 0.5 seconds but I'll add caching anyway"
- Wastes time on non-issues

**Fix:**
- Make it work first
- Optimize if slow (> 3 seconds)
- Test on 3G connection first
- Use Lighthouse to find real bottlenecks

---

## The Golden Rule

> **Start simple. Add practices as needed.**
>
> Begin with BASIC practices. As your project grows in importance, users, or duration, add more practices.
>
> Don't overwhelm yourself trying to use everything at once.

## Decision Checklist

Use this checklist to decide your level:

```
☐ Who will use it?
  ☐ Just me → BASIC
  ☐ Classmates → MEDIUM
  ☐ Real users → FULL
  ☐ Government → CRITICAL

☐ What happens if it breaks?
  ☐ Bad grade → BASIC
  ☐ Annoyed users → MEDIUM
  ☐ Lost money → FULL
  ☐ Legal issues → CRITICAL

☐ How long will it run?
  ☐ 1 week → BASIC
  ☐ 1 semester → MEDIUM
  ☐ 6+ months → FULL
  ☐ Permanent → CRITICAL

☐ How much traffic?
  ☐ < 10 users → BASIC
  ☐ 10-100 users → MEDIUM
  ☐ 100-1000 users → FULL
  ☐ 1000+ users → CRITICAL
```

**Most common answer = Your level**

Example:
- Just me, bad grade if breaks, 1 week, < 10 users
- Answer: BASIC (4/4)

Example 2:
- Real users, lost money if breaks, 6+ months, 100-1000 users
- Answer: FULL (4/4)
